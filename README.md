> Open-Source Desktop application for Graphite. (Practically wraps the web-app for now)

## Install

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Usage

```sh
pnpm run dev:native
```

## Run executable locally

> After these commands you'll find the installer in `/src-tauri/target/release/bundle` depending on your platform. Automated releases towards github will be coming in the near future as well though.

```sh
pnpm tauri build && pnpm run preview:native-[win/linux]
```

## What to expect?

When opening the app, you'll first be welcomed with the following screen where the app checks if Graphite is up and reachable:

On windows you'll get (after logging in) the following screen (could change upstream at some point):
